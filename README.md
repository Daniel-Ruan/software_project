project_Name: MineSweeper 
 

Minesweepers, it is a classical game. 

We want to promote this game and add more customer style of this game 

the software will be applied as agile development process. 

Due Minesweepers is a small game, it is not suitable to use a waterfall model. Moreover, we want to add some customer style in game interface as possible. So, agile method is the best way to finish this project. 

As we know, Minesweeper is fast track to getting outside when get in a trouble mind or take a break. it's funny game and can practice our brain about speculate and reaction of calculation. 

we would prefer to promote this game to younger teen as below 15 ages. the game can practice their thinking and algorithm. As our destination, we hope teen can use this opportunity to open their thinking, even make more like-minded friends.
